I hold no liability and this software comes with no warranty of any kind.
The code contained herein is a modified version of Matthijs Hollemans'.


## Building

To build this software, import the project file into XCode, choose your device, and build.
All code should be up-to-date enough to run on iOS 11. Some compiler warnings are present
but have not been fixed as this was developed a couple of years ago.
